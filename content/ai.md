# AI

LLMs and Agents have a harder time using OCaml due to the reduced content available.
Nevertheless, LLMs can do a decent job of writing code, and OCaml's strong type system helps them iterate successfully.

## MCP Servers

In order for AI agents to use tools effectively, they need access to those tools.
The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) standard has emerged as a gateway between AIs and things other than simple textual input/output.
