# User Interface

## GUI

* [Revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) **WIP**:
A brand-new (and exciting) OCaml/ReasonML-based GUI.
Revery stands as a native, cross-platform alternative to Electron.
* [Brisk](https://github.com/briskml/brisk) **WIP**:
Rather than taking Revery's approach of having a uniform interface,
Brisk aims to use native platform APIs do draw OS-based GUI elements.
* [lablgtk](http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/):
GTK2 bindings for OCaml with various higher-level facilities to define GUIs.
* [lablqml](https://github.com/Kakadu/lablqml):
QML Qt5 bindings for OCaml.
* [labltk](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/labltk/):
Interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI framework.

## TUI (Terminals)
* [Lambda-Term](https://github.com/diml/lambda-term):
Lambda-Term is a cross-platform library for manipulating the terminal.
\It provides an abstraction for keys, mouse events, colors, as well as a set of widgets to write curses-like applications.
* [Notty](https://github.com/pqwy/notty):
Notty is a declarative terminal library for OCaml, structured around a notion of composable images.
